# QuantumSimulator

This is my version of a quantum simulator in java, which does something very simmilar to IBM's quantum compposer.

To use this application, run the jar file with the "java-jar" command with the TestStuff.qasm file in the same directory.
A qasm file can be created through IBM's quantum composer with the appropriate gates. 

Note: can handle most of the basic gates
and the CNOT entanglement gate. For exact gates, see the Gates.Java file in the src folder which statically creates the 
matricies for specific gates. More gates can be created in this file.

For more general info, see report.pdf.
